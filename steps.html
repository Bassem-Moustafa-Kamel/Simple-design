Steps to design this template :

Layout header:

1) Write the very beginging of the basic HTML tags and link the used CSS files 
2) Th epage will be divided into boxes first and each box has its own color
3) The body of the page has a white color ,so there is no need to put a color to the body 
4) We added the container to wrap the page into it and put the content in the middle of the page like 
the standard used screen sizes
5) We should wrap each section in the container not wrapping all the template in one container to make the whole 
content in the template matches the same margin and be in the middle of the page

6) The navbar at the bottom of the first page will be wrapped in a container , and the slider at the top of the page will be wrapped also giving it the image as a background 

7) We should get the color of the navbar using the color picker then paste it as a background
8) List the navbar links and use list_style none prperty to remove the original characteristics
9) We used the class container inside the navbar class to make the container just wrap the content and make the color of the navbar take the full width

10) Then we add the logo and make it float left and the ul will float right then ue overflow hidden to the navbar itself
11) Let's begin the slider and add its height


Layout content :

1) At the top of features page we have three content coloumns ,so each will have class container to wrap the content and all of them will be in class container
2) First the features class should be overflow hidden to make the elements within not to overflow outside 
3) Add the rest of the content normally 
4) We should add some padding to the top and bottom to separate the image from the image from the containers


About-Me :

1) Make a large div with class about-me and class container to wrap the content
2) We made both the image and the content to float left and the image to be 100% of the width of its wrapping div
3) We created the four divs inside the big one to wrap them
4) We gave the divs inside the info a float left with width 50% to make each two divs in one column


My Skills:
 
1) Give the skiils and progress divs 50% width and float left to make them next to each other
2) Then we add some content


My-education :

1) It has a container to wrap the content and two sections with float left property
2) we add hr tag to separate and then repeate the two divs ,but here we should add clear both property to the clearfix class to stop the function of the float left
